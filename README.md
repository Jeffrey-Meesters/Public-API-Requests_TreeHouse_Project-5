## CSS Additions
I made the cards more dynamic by adding a perspective attribute to the .gallery selector.
Also I made the cards transform on the x and y axis to give them even more depth including box-shadow.
And on hovering over the cards they return to their 'normal' state so it seems like they are pushed flat.
On hovering also the font and background color change and the font family changes to another google font.
I left the pop-up almost untouched but for the next and previous button.
There when the user is on the first or last user card the previous or next button gets disabled.
When the button is disabled it becomes soft red and the cursor pointer changes to an not allowed cursor.
All those features can be seen in de gif above. For this project I am again aiming for exceeds expectations.
